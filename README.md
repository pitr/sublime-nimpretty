# Sublime Nimpretty

Sublime Text 3 package to add support for running nimpretty on your Nim code. It runs on save by default, but that can be disabled. You can run it
manually via a palette command (`Nimpretty: Format this file`).

If nimpretty encounters errors, the plugin will mark the lines and highlight those
errors in your source file.
